This project was built for Government of Harayana, India. 
The usecase was to track all the oxygen cylinders that were being used during the COVID-19 crisis in India. We built a mobile app using which a person could scan the cylinder once they receive it.
This allowed the authorities to track the cylinder, pinpoint the bottlenecks and reclaim the cylinders from relevant stakeholders.
